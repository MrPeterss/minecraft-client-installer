# minecraft-client-installer
Automatically installs files and adds a profile to your launcher profiles

## What is this?
Minecraft Client Installer is a simple tool that can automatically add files for Minecraft Mods in the correct directories to play and will automatically create a new Minecraft Launcher profile when the executable is run. This tool is great for people who have trouble with computers but still wish to enjoy Minecraft Mods.

## How does it work?
This project utilizes C# and .NET Core to build a standalone EXE file to accomplish all the steps of installing minecraft mods with one simple click. Simply click the exe, wait for the installation, and everything will be exactly where it is needed.

## The Future of this Project
Hopefully, a full application that includes a proper UI will be available for the user to select different mods, minecraft versions, and other customizable features. Right now, the code is hardcoded to install a Minecraft Forge 1.18.2, a plane mod, and other various optimization mods.
